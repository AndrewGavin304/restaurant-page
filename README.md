# Fiamata Restaurant - The Odin Project Assignment

## Website created with the following restrictions:
1. Skeleton index.html with minimal content
2. Site is all one page - should never leave homepage URL
3. Additional elements (menu section, contact section, etc.) are appended to DOM and removed when user goes to a different section

### Personal goals for project:
1. Attractive, realistic site that could be used professionally
2. Responsive design
3. Mobile compatible with no significant issues
4. Heavily utilize webpack
5. Clean, DRY, and modular CSS and JS

Notes:
Menu section is minimal (no images) for mobile compatibility, flexibility in a real-world environment (menu changes), and an industry trend in this direction (perhaps for those reasons)
